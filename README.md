# AI Note Web App

This is a note-taking app with an integrated **AI chatbot**. By using the **ChatGPT API**, **vector embeddings**, and **Pinecone**, the chatbot knows about all the notes in the account which makes it possible to ask questions about the notes.

Vercel AI SDK was used to implement response-streaming.

The app is built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, and TypeScript.

Supports **dark mode**, and mobile devices.
